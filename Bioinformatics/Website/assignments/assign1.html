			<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
			<ol>
				<li> Is your assignments page up with .htaccess protection?
					<p>Yes</p>
				</li><li> What is the difference between "genotype" and "phenotype"?
					<p>The genotype is the hereditary information passed on from one generation to the next while the phenotype is the expression of the genotype into observable characteristics.</p>
				</li><li> Define the following terms:
				<ul>
				<li> pleiotropy
					<p>The expression of several different phenotypic effects from a single genotypic alteration.</p>
				</li><li> allele
					<p>A pair or series of genes at a particular "locus" on each of the chromosomes in a diploid pair.</p>
				</li><li> genome
					<p>The complete sequence of DNA base-pairs.</p>
				</li><li> gene
					<p>Information responsible for the eventual creation of one or more proteins.</p>
				</li><li> Intron splicing
					<p>Parts of the DNA which are not expressed as proteins are often rearranged by various means, aka spliced.</p>
				</li><li> Positive Selection
					<p>A gene in the germline that provides some benefit is preserved through positive selection.</p>
				</li><li> Negative Selection
					<p>A gene in the germline that has a neutral or deleterious effect is likely to lead to death (negative selection).</p>
				</li><li> Polymerase
					<p>The biomachinery that copies DNA.</p>
				</li><li> Phylogenetic Relationships
					<p>An attempt to place gene sequences in an evolutionary tree showing relationships between current and past mutations.</p>
				</li><li> Transitions
					<p>When a purene or pyramidene base swaps with its own kind (e.g. A with G, or C with T).</p>
				</li><li> Transversions
					<p>When a purine or pyramidene base swaps with the other kind (e.g. A with C, or A with T).</p>
				</li><li> Homology
					<p>Similarities between genetic sequences between different species, i.e. a search to uncover shared ancestry in the evolutionary tree.</p>
				</li><li> Paralogy
					<p>A duplicated gene that has found a home in some other part of the genome.</p>
				</li></ul>

				</li><li> How many possible unique human genomes are there?
					<p>More than the estimated number of particles in the universe... 4<sup>3,000,000,000</sup></p>
				</li><li> What are the causes of genetic variation?
					<p>So many!  There are chemical factors that can replace base bairs; there are chromosomal swaps and mutations; sometimes there can be frame shifts while copying DNA... I've probably missed several as well.</p>
				</li><li> What are the error rates for copying RNA viruses and how does this compare to bacteria?
					<p>RNA viruses have a much higher error rate, e.g. 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> as compared to about 1 in 10<sup>10</sup> in bacteria.</p>
				</li><li> What happens to Drosophila when they have the Antennapedia mutation in the Hox gene?
					<p>Legs for antennae!</p>
				</li><li> Why is gene duplication important to evolution?
					<p>With a "backup set" of information, the duplicate can be altered with less chance of negative selection.</p>
				</li><li> What role does a knowledge of selection and evolution play in the treatment of cancer?
					<p>There is a certain toleration for mutation built into the system so that positive change can occur; however, since a lot of mutation would be disastrous, the cell has evolved mechanisms that help it preserve the accuracy of the genome.  If we can tap into these natural mechanisms then perhaps cancerous prolificacy of cells can be mitigated.</p>
				</li><li> In the comparison of Next-Generation sequencing platforms, how many mutations each platform was able to detect?
					<p>They found 14 mutations (plus 3 false positives due to incorrect reference sequence)</p>
				</li><li> What depth of sequence coverage is necesssary in order to hit the plateau of low false positives and false negatives with each technology?
					<p>10 to 15 times</p>
				</li><li> Which out-of-the-box solution works well for all sequencing projects?
					<p>The Illumina seemed to do better when a reference genome was given, while the 454 seemed well suited for all tasks in general.</p>
				</li><li> How many cells in your body grow and divide every day?
					<p>I missed this one, and couldn't find it online either... but I'd like to know!</p>
				</li><li> What is the difference between Eukaryotic cells and Prokaryotic cells?
					<p>Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and are in more advanced species.</p>
				</li><li> What is the mitochondria and what is its function?
					<p>The cellular "powerhouse" and regulator.</p>
				</li><li> What is the Golgi Apparatus and what is its function?
					<p>A multi-layered organelle that packages and processes proteins and lipids in the cell (eukaryotes).</p>
				</li><li> How many ribosomes does each human cell have?
					<p>About 20,000 depending on the cell (e.g. in contrast to most cells, red blood cells have none)</p>
				</li><li> What percentage of the cell is proteins (by volume)?
					<p>About 40% [<a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-10/939838831.Cb.r.html">source</a>]</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h1>My Notes for Later</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>What is "color-space alignments"?</li>
				<li>What is meant by "the fraction of mutations in open reading frames (78%) was slightly higher than the average gene density (56%)"?</li>
				<li>Is there a difference between "phylogenetic relationships" and "homology"?</li>
			</ul>
