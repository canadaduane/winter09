Butt caps / Round caps / Projected end caps

Mitre joint / Round joint / Bevel joint

Antialiasing
	supersampling - use subpixels
	area sampling - compute area of overlap for each pixel
	bresenham     - use magnitude of decision variable
	pixel phasing - micropositioning of electron beam
	
Translating coordinate systems
	- change the destination to look like the source

Affine
	parallel lines remain parallel
	finite points -> finite points

Can we review bundled attributes?
Why can't reflection in 3D occur across a plane?
What is shearing in 3D like?
To transform from an arbitrary 3D coordinate system to another arbitrary 3D coordinate system, how many matrices are composed?
How many matrices are composed at runtime (0) and "in advance" for rotation of a 2D polygon?
How many are composed for a 3D rotation? (5?)
How does the following matrix represent scaling, rotation and reflection?
	[-1  0  0]

	[ 0  0  1]
Why prefer to attribute a "window" to the world, over the display? (2006, q. 14)
What is the difference between a window and a viewport?

23.  When three matrices are composed to provide rotation about an arbitrary point and the composed matrix is applied to the data describing the shape to be rotated, the arbitrary point is translated to the origin, the rotation occurs about the origin, and the arbitrary point is returned to its original position.
