	symmetric DDA
	- use 2^n as denominator

	Bresenham's Algorithm

Drawing Circles
	x^2 + y^2 = r^2 ("We may be slow, but we're shoddy")

Planar Polygon

How do you find the Normal?
	x1,y1,z1 | x2,y2,z2 | x3,y3,z3

	x-x1 , y-y1 , z-z1
	x2-y1, y2-y1, z2-z1
	x3-x1, y3-y1, z3-z1

	find determinant


	ex.

	A = y1(z2-z3) + y2(z3-z1) + y3(z1-z2)
	B = z1(x2-x3) + z2(x3-x1) + z3(x1-x2)
	C = x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2)
	D = -x1...

1.  The ink is an ink jet printer is deflected
      1. magnetically
      2. electrostatically
      3. mechanically
      4. (it is not deflected; it is deposited in a raster fashion on a selenium drum)

8.  The line segment goes between (0,0) and (50, -60).  Which of the following happens at every step of the execution of the symmetric  DDA algorithm?
      1. x increases by 1
      2. y increases by 1
      3. x decreases by 1
      4. y decreases by 1
      5. (none of the above)

14.  What’s wrong using the DDA technique (vs. Bresenham) for a circle to determine x and y values?
       1. nothing
       2. it’s slow, but uniform
       3. is fast, but not uniform
       4. it’s both slow and nonuniform
       5. it doesn’t really make a circle

17.  For drawing a hollow circle, all the pixels should
       1. be centered as close as possible on the actual circle
       2. be contained inside the actual circle
       3. be on the outside of the actual circle

21.  The plane Ax + By + Cz + D = 0 has at least one feature different from the plane –Ax – By – Cz – D = 0.
       1. true
       2. false

23.  What is a polymarker?
       1. a marker with RGB components
       2. a collection of markers
       3. an attribute of a polygon describing its visibility (or invisibility)

24.  Graphics systems are not capable of presenting either points or line segments.  At best, they can present small or narrow areas.
       1. true
       2. false

5. Which of the following touch panels is likely to be least accurate? (why optical?)
      1. optical
      2. electrical
      3. acoustical

How is the ink in an inkjet printer deflected?

11. With the advent of raster displays, it was necessary, for the first time, to pick discrete points with which to represent a line segment on a graphics display. (What discrete points preceded?)
       1. true
       2. false

Why do we use the lower-left corner of pixels again?

24. Ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, while standard geometric shapes, are not particularly useful in most graphics applications because shapes are rarely elliptical, parabolic, or hyperbolic. (why false?)
       1. true
       2. false

31. Which of the following poses the least problems: (why b? Does a pose problems?)
       1. a 4-connect boundary and a 4-connect fill
       2. a 4 connect boundary and an 8-connect fill
       3. an 8 connect boundary and an 8-connect fill
       4. an 8 connect boundary and a 4-connect fill

33. A polygon consists on n vertices. Into how many polygons does it need to be split so that each polygon lies entirely in plane? Assume n >= 3. (why c?)
       1. n
       2. n-1
       3. n-2
       4. n-3
       5. (can’t say in general)

36. When filling a polygon with a repeating pattern (think “tiles”), the starting point for the first tile can be anywhere EXCEPT (e. no exceptions)
       1. at a vertex
       2. at a corner of the bounding rectangle
       3. interior to the polygon
       4. outside the bounding rectangle
       5. (no exceptions here)
