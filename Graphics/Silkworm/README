== Installation:

  Silkworm requires the following external libraries:

    - OpenGL
        Standardized 3D graphics library
    - FTGL 2.1.3
        Font-loading library for OpenGL
        (NOTE: As of this writing (Mar 4, 2009) the FTGL library in MacPorts is version 2.1.2 and therefore will not work. Visit http://ftgl.wiki.sourceforge.net/ and download 2.1.3 and compile yourself.)
    
  Install the following Cabal packages for Haskell:
    
    - OpenGL
        Bindings to the OpenGL library
        (cabal install opengl)
    - pngload-0.1 (Codec.Image.PNG)
        Native Haskell PNG loader
        (cabal install pngload)
    - Hipmunk-0.2.1
        Chipmunk 2D physics engine + binding
        (cabal install hipmunk)
    - GLFW-0.3
        Cross-platform native window library
        (cabal install glfw)
    - FTGL-1.1
        Bindings for external FTGL library
        (cabal install ftgl)

== Compiling:

  Silkworm has been developed and tested on a Mac, so it currently does not support Linux or Windows (but feel free to try if you'd like, and let me know how it goes!).

  After following the installation instructions above:
  
  $ make
  
  And if that is successful:
  
  $ make run

  If things go terriby wrong, you might first try to get the playground running:
  
  $ make Playground
  
  And then:
  
  $ make RunPlayground
