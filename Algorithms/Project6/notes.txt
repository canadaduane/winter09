1. choose the non-basic variable whose coefficient in the objective function is largest
2. choose the constraining equations whose (constant) slack variable would most be affected by increasing the non-basic variable from (1)
  - i.e. divide slack variable by coefficient in front of the chosen non-basic variable
  - pick the corresponding lowest basic variable
  - value of non-basic variable = lowest
3. pivot on the basic variable whose value is now zero

z (the objective function) always consists of non-basic variables
