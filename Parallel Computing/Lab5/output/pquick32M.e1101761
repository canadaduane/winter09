orterun: killing job...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: orterun is in the process of killing a job, but has detected an
interruption (probably control-C).

It is dangerous to interrupt orterun while it is killing a job (proper
termination may not be guaranteed).  Hit control-C again within 1
second if you really want to kill orterun immediately.
